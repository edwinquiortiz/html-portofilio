<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Grace is that dignified elegance about a person's appearance, 
  movement, personal style or behavior. To be graceful is to be 
  strong and assured in who one is and to move gently within that energy.</p>

<p>Exceptional people live with a sense of inner elegance and are graceful 
  even amidst a challenge. They are able to handle themselves in a 
  noble and ethical manner. They hold good posture, their energy has a mystery, 
  softness, strength and cleverness to it. They are vulnerable yet self-assured.</p>

<p>Composure is the beauty of self-control. Exceptional people accept that life is always going to bring its challenges and are aware that without a sense of composure it is too easy to allow conflict in situations and relationships to unnerve them. 
  They embrace the concept of less equals more.

  Exceptional people understand the less they react, defend, explain, become 
  fearful or controlling, the more command they have over a situation. 
  Having composure allows them to stand tall with resilience in the face 
  of loss and challenge. They are also mindful to not be boastful about 
  their success.</p>
